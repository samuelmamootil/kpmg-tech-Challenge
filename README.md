# Challenge 1 Architecture Diagram 

A 3-tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these

# Challenge 2 Get Nested Object Value 

We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within AWS or Azure or GCP
and provide a json formatted output.
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

# Challenge 3 Metadata Output 

We have a nested object. We would like a function where you pass in the object and a key and
get back the value.
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.
